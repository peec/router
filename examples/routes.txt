# Pattern to add routes:
#     [Name of route]        [HTTP METHOD or *]      [URL SPECIFICATION]      [Callable assignment: Classpath.method]
#
# You can set variables with %set
# Variables:
#     exact_match
#     Automatically wrap the url specification with the regular expression pattern ^$ to match all routes.
#



# Routes below now don't need to add ^$ to URL because its added automatically.
%set exact_match 1


# Our homepage, thus only allow get requests.
home      GET      /        SomeController.home

# Some blog
blog      *      /blog        SomeController.blog


# From now on disable automatically insert of ^$.
%set exact_match 0

# And we need to add ^$ ourselves if not we match urls like /news321321 and /test/news and not only /news
news      *      ^/news$        SomeController.news
